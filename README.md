# iHerb.com Cart Page Redesign

I redesigned iHerb.com's Cart page, focusing on a completely responsive design and a more friendly UX.

**Live Site\***: https://bruce-c-liu.github.io/iherb-cart-page-redesign/

*This is a proof of concept. Most links are placeholders. Not all elements of original Cart Page were implemented (e.g. omitted Navigation Dropdowns, Shipping Estimates, Lists, Buy It Again, and footer). I encourage you to visit the redesigned site and play around with the browser window width to best experience the page's seamless responsiveness. :)
