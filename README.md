I redesigned iHerb.com's Cart page, focusing on a consistent responsive design and a more friendly UX.

Live Site\*: https://bruce-c-liu.github.io/iherb-cart-page-redesign/

\*This is a proof of concept. Most links are placeholders. Not all elements of original page were implemented (e.g. omitted sections for Navigation Dropdowns, Shipping Estimates, Lists, Buy It Again, and footer). Drawer Menu for small width devices works.
